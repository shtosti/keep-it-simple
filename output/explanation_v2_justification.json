    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds from the environment. These sounds make vibrations. The vibrations travel through a small bone called the stapes. The stapes is part of the middle ear and helps to send sound to the cochlea. The cochlea is the part that receives sound. It is called the auditory receptor. \n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by breaking it into smaller, clearer parts. I used common words and short sentences to make it easier to understand. This helps someone with limited cognitive resources follow the information step by step."
