    "reasoning": "1. **Identify key points**: Focus on main ideas - mice are important for brain research, scientists usually prefer male mice, and female mice have hormonal cycles that can affect results.\n\n2. **Use simpler words**: Replace complex terms like \"neuroscience\" with \"brain science\" and \"behavioral variation\" with \"changes in behavior.\"\n\n3. **Shorten sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for easier understanding.\n\n4. **Remove jargon**: Avoid technical language and explain any necessary terms simply.\n\n5. **Focus on clarity**: Ensure the text is straightforward so it can be easily understood by someone with a basic education level. \n\nThese changes make the text more accessible to readers who may struggle with complex vocabulary and sentence structures.",

    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists can easily control and study mice to learn how the brain works. In the past, researchers often used male mice instead of female mice. They were worried that the hormonal changes in female mice might affect their behavior and the test results."
