    "reasoning": "To simplify the provided text, I will focus on a few key steps:\n\n1. **Identify Key Concepts**: Break down complex ideas, such as why mice are used in neuroscience, the significance of studying male vs. female mice, and the impact of hormone cycles on research results.\n\n2. **Use Simple Language**: Replace difficult words or phrases like \"neuroscience\" and \"hormone cycle\" with easier explanations, such as \"the study of the brain\" and \"changes in female bodies that affect behavior\".\n\n3. **Clarify Relationships**: Explain why male mice are preferred, ensuring the relationship between hormonal effects and research validity is clear.\n\n4. **Shorter Sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones that are easier to read.\n\n5. **Add Explanatory Elements**: Provide examples or context where necessary, to help readers understand the text better without overwhelming them with too much information at once.\n\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the simplified version is accessible and understandable for a wider audience, especially those unfamiliar with scientific terminology. I won\u2019t generate the simplification now, as instructed, but will apply these strategies when I do.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Easy English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. Your simplification can be longer than the source text if making it longer makes it easier to comprehend.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important for research about the brain. Scientists use mice because they can easily control and study them to learn how the brain works. Researchers usually choose male mice instead of female mice for their experiments. This is partly because female mice have hormone cycles, which can cause changes in their behavior. These changes might affect the results of the experiments."
