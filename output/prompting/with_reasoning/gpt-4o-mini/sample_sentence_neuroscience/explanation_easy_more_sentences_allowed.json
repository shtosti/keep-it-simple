    "reasoning": "The target group for this text could be people who are new to neuroscience or those who do not have a scientific background. \n\nTo simplify the source text, I would:\n\n1. **Use Common Words**: Replace scientific terms like \"neuroscience\" with simpler phrases like \"the study of the brain.\"\n2. **Break Down Complex Sentences**: Split longer sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to read and understand.\n3. **Explain Concepts**: Provide brief explanations for terms like \"hormone cycle\" and \"behavioral variation.\"\n4. **Add Examples**: Use simple examples to clarify points, like why researchers are concerned about using female mice.\n5. **Remove Unnecessary Details**: Focus on the main ideas to keep the text clear and concise.\n\nBy making these changes, I would ensure the text is accessible and understandable for a wider audience.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Easy English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. It can contain more sentences than the original if it makes it easier to understand.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in the study of the brain. Scientists use mice to learn how the brain works because they are easy to control and study. Traditionally, researchers have often used male mice in their experiments. They do this because female mice have hormone cycles, which can cause differences in their behavior. These differences might confuse the results of the experiments."
