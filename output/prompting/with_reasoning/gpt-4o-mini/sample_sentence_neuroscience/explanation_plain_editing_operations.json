    "reasoning": "To simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. **Identify Key Concepts**: Focus on the main ideas\u2014mice in neuroscience research, the preference for male mice, and the reason for this preference.\n\n2. **Use Clear Language**: Replace complex phrases with simpler words. For instance, \"central part\" can become \"important,\" and \"hormone cycle\" can be described as \u201cchanges in hormones.\u201d\n\n3. **Shorten Sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for better readability. This helps in making the text more straightforward.\n\n4. **Explain Terms**: Offer brief explanations when needed, like clarifying what \u201cbehavioral variation\u201d means in simple terms.\n\n5. **Remove Unnecessary Details**: Omit less relevant information that does not contribute to understanding the main ideas, while ensuring the core message remains clear.\n\nThese steps would make the text accessible and understandable to a wider audience without losing its essential meaning.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Plain English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. You can freely use the editing opertaions of adding, deleting and paraphrasing words, phrases and sentences.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in neuroscience research because they are easy to study and help scientists understand how the brain works. Researchers usually prefer to use male mice instead of female mice. This is partly because the hormonal changes in female mice can lead to different behaviors, which might affect the experiment results."
