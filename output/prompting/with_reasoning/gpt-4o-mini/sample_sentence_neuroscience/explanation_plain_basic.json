    "reasoning": "The target group here seems to be individuals interested in neuroscience research, including students and the general public who may not have a scientific background.\n\nTo simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. **Identify Key Points**: Focus on the main ideas - mice are important for brain research, male mice are often used more than female mice, and this is due to concerns about hormonal effects.\n\n2. **Use Clear Language**: Replace technical terms with simpler words. For example, instead of \"intricate inner workings,\" use \"complex functions.\"\n\n3. **Shorten Sentences**: Break up longer sentences into shorter, clearer ones to improve readability.\n\n4. **Remove Unnecessary Details**: Eliminate any jargon or complex explanations that may confuse the reader.\n\n5. **Maintain Meaning**: Ensure the simplified version conveys the same meaning as the original text.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t need to perform calculations since the task is purely about language simplification, not numerical analysis.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Plain English.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain because they are easy to manage and observe. Researchers usually use male mice instead of female mice because they worry that the hormonal changes in females might affect the results of the experiments."
