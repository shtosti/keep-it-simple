    "reasoning": "To simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. **Identify the main points**: Mice are important for studying the brain, and scientists usually use male mice because female mice's hormone cycles may affect results.\n\n2. **Remove complex words**: Words like \"intricate\" and \"historically\" would be replaced with simpler terms.\n\n3. **Break down long sentences**: I would split longer sentences into shorter ones for easier understanding.\n\n4. **Clarify concepts**: I would explain terms like \"hormone cycle\" in simpler language.\n\n5. **Keep important details**: I would make sure to include the main ideas about why mice are used and the preference for male mice.\n\nBy following these steps, I would ensure the text is easier to read and understand while still conveying the key information.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Easy English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. You can freely use the editing opertaions of adding, deleting and paraphrasing words, phrases and sentences.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists like to use mice because they can control and study them easily. Most of the time, researchers choose male mice instead of female mice. This is because female mice have hormone cycles that can change their behavior, which might affect the study results."
