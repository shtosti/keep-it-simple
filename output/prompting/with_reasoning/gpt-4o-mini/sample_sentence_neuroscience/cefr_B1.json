    "reasoning": "The target group consists of non-native English speakers with a B1 level, meaning they can understand common topics. They need clear and simple language to grasp the main ideas without confusion.\n\nTo simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. **Use simpler words**: Replace complex words with easier synonyms (e.g., \"intricate\" to \"complex\").\n2. **Shorten sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for better clarity.\n3. **Clarify ideas**: Explain terms that might be difficult, like \"hormone cycle\" and \"behavioral variation.\"\n4. **Remove technical jargon**: Avoid specialized terms that are not commonly known.\n5. **Focus on main points**: Keep the key ideas about mice in research and gender differences.\n\nBy making these changes, I will help the target audience understand the content without overwhelming them with complex vocabulary or ideas.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is B1. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the B1 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes & ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.>",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in brain research. Scientists use mice because they can control them and study how the brain works. In the past, researchers mostly used male mice for experiments. They did this because female mice have a hormone cycle that can change their behavior, which might affect the results."
