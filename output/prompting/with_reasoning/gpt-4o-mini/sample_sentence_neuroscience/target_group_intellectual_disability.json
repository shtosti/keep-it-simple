    "reasoning": "The needs of the target group include clear language, short sentences, and simple concepts. To simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. **Use simple words**: Replace complex terms like \"neuroscience\" and \"intricate\" with easier words.\n2. **Shorten sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for better understanding.\n3. **Explain concepts**: Add simple explanations for terms like \"hormone cycle\" and \"behavioral variation.\"\n4. **Avoid jargon**: Remove or replace any scientific jargon with everyday language.\n\nThese changes will help make the information clearer and more accessible for people with intellectual disabilities.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for the following target group: people with intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, development delay, etc.). Rewrite the text in easy language to make it easily understandable for them.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are small animals often used in science to learn about the brain. Scientists can easily control and study mice. Most researchers have used male mice more than female mice. This is because female mice have changes in their bodies, called hormones, that can affect how they behave. Scientists worry this might change their results."
