    "reasoning": "The target group consists of non-native English speakers at the B2 level, who need clear and understandable information about complex topics. They can understand main ideas but may struggle with complicated language or concepts.\n\nTo simplify the text about mice in neuroscience, I would take the following steps:\n\n1. **Break down sentences**: I would divide long sentences into shorter, simpler ones for better clarity.\n   \n2. **Use common vocabulary**: I would replace complex words or phrases with simpler synonyms that are more commonly understood.\n\n3. **Explain concepts**: I would clarify any technical terms (like \"neuroscience\" or \"hormone cycle\") with brief definitions or simpler explanations.\n\n4. **Remove unnecessary details**: I would remove extraneous information that does not contribute to the main idea to keep the focus clear.\n\n5. **Maintain structure**: I would keep a logical flow so that ideas connect well and are easy to follow.\n\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the simplified text is accessible to the target group while retaining the essential information.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is B2. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the B2 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation. Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party. Can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.>",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research because they are easy to control and study. Scientists use them to learn about how the brain works. In the past, researchers mostly used male mice for experiments. This is partly because they were worried that female mice's hormone cycles could change their behavior and affect the results."
