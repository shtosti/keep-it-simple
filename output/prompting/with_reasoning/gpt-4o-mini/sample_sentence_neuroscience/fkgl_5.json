    "reasoning": "To simplify the text for children while targeting a reading level of FKGL 5, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Complex Text**: The original text contains complex vocabulary and concepts related to neuroscience and research practices.\n\n2. **Break Down Sentences**: I would divide long sentences into shorter ones to improve readability. For example, the sentence about researchers favoring male mice can be split into two.\n\n3. **Simplify Vocabulary**: I would replace complex words like \"neuroscience,\" \"intricate,\" and \"behavioral variation\" with simpler terms such as \"brain study,\" \"complex,\" and \"changes in behavior.\"\n\n4. **Clarify Concepts**: I would explain any scientific concepts in simpler terms, providing context if necessary. For example, I would briefly explain what a hormone cycle is in simple language.\n\n5. **Check Readability**: I would calculate the FKGL score of the new text using the formula. This involves counting the total number of words, sentences, and syllables in the text.\n\nBy making these changes, I will create a text that is easier for children to understand while still conveying the main ideas of the original content. I will not generate the simplified text yet but have outlined the method for achieving an FKGL score of 5.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 5.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists can control and study them easily. Normally, researchers choose male mice for experiments instead of female mice. They worry that the hormone cycle in female mice might cause different behaviors. This could affect the results of their studies."
