    "reasoning": "The target group for the original text includes researchers and scientists interested in neuroscience.\n\nTo simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. Identify key ideas: the role of mice in neuroscience, preference for male mice, and issues with female mice's hormonal cycles.\n2. Remove non-essential details and jargon to make it more concise.\n3. Calculate the character count: the original text has 477 characters, thus the simplified version should have about 239 characters for 0.5 of the original.\n4. Use straightforward language to make the content accessible while retaining the main message.\n\nNext, I would proceed to create the simplified text.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of characters in the output text should be 0.5 of the original.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are key in neuroscience research, allowing studies of brain functions. Researchers often prefer male mice over females due to hormonal cycles in females, which may affect results."
