    "reasoning": "To simplify the text, I would first identify the main ideas: \n\n1. Mice are important in neuroscience research.\n2. Male mice are predominantly used in experiments.\n3. Female mice are often excluded due to hormonal variations affecting results.\n\nNext, I would aim to retain these key points while reducing the word count to 90% of the original (which is 64 words). Thus, my target would be approximately 58 words. Changes would include:\n\n- Removing repetitive phrases (e.g., \"long been a central part\u201d to just \u201cimportant\u201d).\n- Condensing explanations (e.g., combining sentences about male preference and concerns about hormonal cycles).\n- Simplifying language for clearer understanding.\n\nAfter recalculating, I'd aim for a concise summary that communicates the essentials without losing the original meaning.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of words in the output text should be 0.9 of the original.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in neuroscience research, providing a controllable model to study the brain. Researchers often prefer male mice for experiments because concerns about female hormonal cycles can lead to behavioral variations that affect results."
