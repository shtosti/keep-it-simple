    "reasoning": "The target group, A2 level English speakers, needs simple language due to limited vocabulary and comprehension skills. \n\nTo simplify the source text, I would:\n\n1. **Use Simple Words**: Replace complex words with easier ones. For example, change \"intricate\" to \"complex\" or \"difficult.\"\n  \n2. **Shorten Sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for easier understanding.\n\n3. **Avoid Technical Terms**: Remove or explain any scientific terms, like \"neuroscience,\" to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Focus on Main Ideas**: Keep important points but remove extra details that make it complicated.\n\n5. **Use Everyday Language**: Use common expressions that the target group is likely to know.\n\nThis approach is necessary to ensure the information is clear and accessible to non-native speakers at the A2 level, who may struggle with complicated language and concepts.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is A2. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the A2 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.>",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in brain research. Scientists use them to learn how the brain works. Researchers usually test male mice more than female mice. They do this because female mice have hormone changes that can make their behavior different. This can affect the results of the tests."
