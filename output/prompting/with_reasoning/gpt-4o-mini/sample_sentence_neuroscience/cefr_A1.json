    "reasoning": "The target group needs simple language and familiar words. They should understand everyday topics and basic phrases. \n\nTo simplify the text, I would: \n\n1. **Use simple words**: Replace complex words like \u201cneuroscience\u201d and \u201cintricate\u201d with everyday language.\n2. **Shorten sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for clarity.\n3. **Explain terms**: Remove or clearly explain terms that may be difficult.\n4. **Focus on key ideas**: Keep only important points about mice in research and their use in science.\n5. **Avoid scientific detail**: Remove specific details about hormones and behavior that may confuse the reader.\n\nThese changes will make the text easier to read and understand for A1 level speakers.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is A1. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the A1 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.>",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice because they can control them easily. In the past, researchers focused on male mice more than female mice. They did this because female mice have a hormone cycle that can change how they act. This can affect research results."
