    "reasoning": "The target group specified in the text includes scientists and researchers in neuroscience. \n\nTo simplify the text, I would first calculate the character count: the original text has 379 characters. Reducing it to 70% gives approximately 265 characters. \n\nI would focus on the key points: the role of mice in research, the preference for male mice, and the reason behind that choice. The changes would involve reducing unnecessary details and rephrasing for brevity while maintaining the core message. This would create a more concise and accessible version for readers.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of characters in the output text should be 0.7 of the original.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice play a key role in neuroscience research, allowing scientists to study brain mechanisms. Researchers often prefer male mice because female hormone cycles can cause behavioral changes that may affect experiment results."
