    "reasoning": "The target group specified in the text is researchers working in neuroscience, particularly those studying mice as models for brain research. Their needs include reliable and controlled experimental conditions to accurately understand brain functions.\n\nTo simplify the text, I would break down complex ideas into simpler sentences and replace technical jargon with everyday language. For example, instead of \"intricate inner workings,\" I might say \"how the brain works.\" I would clarify terms like \"hormone cycle\" and \"behavioral variation\" by using simpler phrases or providing brief explanations. \n\nI would also remove unnecessary details that could confuse the reader and focus on the main points, such as why male mice are preferred for experiments. This approach helps make the text more accessible to readers who may not have a scientific background or detailed knowledge of neuroscience research.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Plain English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. It can contain more sentences than the original if it makes it easier to understand.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are commonly used in brain research because they are easy to study and control. Researchers usually prefer male mice for experiments. This is partly because female mice have hormone cycles that can cause changes in behavior, which might affect the results of the studies."
