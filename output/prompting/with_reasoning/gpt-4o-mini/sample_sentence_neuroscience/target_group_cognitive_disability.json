    "reasoning": "The needs of the target group include clear language, shorter sentences, and simple vocabulary to enhance understanding.\n\nTo simplify the text, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Key Ideas**: Focus on the main points: mice in research, preference for male mice, and hormone cycles in females.\n  \n2. **Use Simple Words**: Replace complex words with simpler alternatives (e.g., \"scientists\" could become \"researchers\").\n\n3. **Shorten Sentences**: Break long sentences into shorter ones for easier reading.\n\n4. **Clarify Concepts**: Explain terms like \"hormone cycle\" in simpler language (e.g., \"changes in female mice\").\n\n5. **Remove Unnecessary Details**: Eliminate any information that does not directly contribute to understanding the main ideas.\n\nThis approach will help create a version of the text that is more accessible for people with cognitive disabilities.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for the following target group: people with cognitive disabilities (dyslexia, ADHD, autism, etc.). Rewrite the text in plain language to make it easily understandable for them.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research. They help scientists learn about how the brain works. Researchers usually use male mice instead of female mice. This is because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can change their behavior and make the results of the research confusing."
