    "reasoning": "The target group likely includes young children or early readers. To simplify the text, I would:\n\n1. **Shorten Sentences**: Break down long sentences into shorter, clearer ones for easier understanding.\n2. **Simplify Vocabulary**: Replace complex words like \u201cneuroscience\u201d and \u201cbehavioral variation\u201d with simpler terms like \"brain study\" or \"differences in behavior.\"\n3. **Clarify Concepts**: Use relatable examples or explanations to make concepts understandable, such as describing what hormones do in simple terms.\n\nI would calculate the FKGL score of the original text to ensure the simplified version approximates a score of 2. I would focus on keeping the average number of words per sentence lower and making sure that the percentage of syllables does not raise the reading level.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 2.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for brain studies. Scientists use them to learn how the brain works. In the past, researchers mostly used male mice. They were worried that female mice might behave differently because of hormones, which could change the results."
