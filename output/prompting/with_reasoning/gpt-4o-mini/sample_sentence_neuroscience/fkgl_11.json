    "reasoning": "To simplify the text for a target group, such as upper elementary or middle school students, I would:\n\n1. **Break Down Complex Sentences**: I would split longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones for better understanding. For example, instead of having one long sentence about the role of mice, I\u2019d separate the information about research and why mice are studied.\n\n2. **Use Simple Vocabulary**: I would replace complex terms like \"neuroscience\" and \"intricate\" with simpler words that children might already know, like \"brain science\" and \"complex.\"\n\n3. **Explain Concepts Clearly**: I would provide definitions or explanations for terms that may not be familiar, like the \"hormone cycle.\"\n\n4. **Minimize Jargon**: I would reduce technical language and jargon to make it more relatable to a younger audience.\n\n5. **Calculation for FKGL**: After making these changes, I would check the FKGL score to ensure it approximates a score of 11. This involves counting words, sentences, and syllables in the new version and applying the FKGL formula: \n   - Words per sentence: (total words)/(total sentences)\n   - Syllables per word: (total syllables)/(total words)\n   - Then use the FKGL formula.\n\nThese adjustments would make the text more accessible for the target audience while keeping the essential information intact.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 11.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research because scientists can easily control and study them to learn about how the brain works. For a long time, researchers have mostly used male mice in experiments. They are concerned that female mice behave differently because of their hormone cycle, which might affect the results."
