    "reasoning": "The target group specified in the text is scientists and researchers in neuroscience who study brain functions using mice as models. \n\nTo simplify the original text, I would:\n1. Break down complex phrases into simpler language. For example, instead of \"a central part of neuroscience research,\" I would use \"an important part of studying the brain.\"\n2. Eliminate technical jargon or explain it in simpler terms. For instance, instead of \"hormone cycle,\" I would say \"hormones that change throughout the month.\"\n3. Use shorter sentences to enhance clarity and make the text easier to read.\n4. Retain the key ideas but present them in a way that is more relatable and straightforward for a broader audience.\n\nI would not include any calculations, as the simplification focuses solely on language clarity and comprehension.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Plain English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. Your simplification can be longer than the source text if making it longer makes it easier to comprehend.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important for studying the brain in neuroscience research. Scientists often use mice because they can control and study them easily. Traditionally, researchers have preferred using male mice instead of female mice. This is partly because female mice have hormone changes that can affect their behavior, which might make it harder to get clear results in experiments."
