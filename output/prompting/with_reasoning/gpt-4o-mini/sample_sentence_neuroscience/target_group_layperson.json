    "reasoning": "The target group consists of laypeople with no specialized knowledge in neuroscience. They need clear, simple explanations that avoid technical terms and complex concepts.\n\nTo simplify the source text, I would:\n\n1. **Identify Key Ideas**: Focus on the main points\u2014mice are used in brain research, male mice are preferred over female mice, and this is because of hormonal differences.\n\n2. **Use Simple Language**: Replace technical terms like \"neuroscience\" and \"hormone cycle\" with everyday language that anyone can understand.\n\n3. **Break Down Concepts**: Explain any necessary concepts one at a time, ensuring each idea is straightforward and relatable.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Details**: Remove details that might confuse the reader, such as the specifics of experimental design, to keep the focus on why male mice are chosen.\n\nBy following these steps, I can make the information accessible and engaging for the target audience.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for the following target group: laypeople with no domain knowledge. Rewrite the text in plain language to make it easily understandable for them.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are often used in research to understand how the brain works. Scientists usually prefer to study male mice instead of female mice. This is mainly because female mice have hormone changes that can affect their behavior, which might complicate the results of the experiments."
