    "reasoning": "To simplify the source text, I would first determine the original word count, which is 79 words. According to the instruction for a simplification at 0.5 of the original length, the output should be 40 words. \n\nThe changes would involve:\n1. Reducing complex phrases to simpler language.\n2. Removing less essential details while retaining the core message about mice in neuroscience and the preference for male over female mice.\n\nThis approach will help in maintaining clarity and conveying the essential points effectively.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of words in the output text should be 0.5 of the original.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are crucial for neuroscience research, as they offer a controllable model for studying the brain. Researchers typically use male mice instead of female mice due to concerns that hormonal changes in females may affect experiment results."
