    "reasoning": "To simplify the text while aiming for an FKGL score of 8, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. **Shorten Sentences**: Break down long sentences into shorter, simpler ones. This can help reduce the words per sentence ratio.\n  \n2. **Use Simpler Words**: Replace complex words like \"neuroscience,\" \"intricate,\" and \"behavioral variation\" with easier synonyms such as \"brain studies,\" \"complex,\" and \"changes in behavior.\"\n  \n3. **Clarify Concepts**: Explain terms like \"hormone cycle\" in a more relatable way, perhaps saying \"changes in female bodies each month.\"\n\n4. **Eliminate Unnecessary Details**: Focus on the main idea without excessive detail, ensuring clarity while keeping essential information.\n\n5. **Syllable Reduction**: Aim to use words with fewer syllables to meet the target for syllables per word.\n\nAfter making these changes, I would need to count the new words, sentences, and syllables to ensure the FKGL score approxim",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 8.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain studies because scientists can control and observe them to learn how the brain works. In the past, researchers usually used male mice instead of female mice. They did this because they were worried that the monthly changes in female mice could affect the results of the experiments."
