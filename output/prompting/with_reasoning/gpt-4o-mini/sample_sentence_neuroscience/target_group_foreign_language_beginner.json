    "reasoning": "The target group needs simple language and clear explanations to understand complex ideas. \n\nTo simplify the text, I would:\n1. Use shorter sentences to make reading easier.\n2. Replace difficult words with simpler ones (e.g., \"research\" becomes \"study\").\n3. Remove extra details that are not necessary for basic understanding.\n4. Use simpler sentence structures to help beginners follow the text.\n\nThese changes will make the text easier to read and understand for non-native English speakers with a beginner level.",
    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for the following target group: non-native English speakers with a beginner level of English. Rewrite the text in plain language to make it easily understandable for them.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in studying the brain. Scientists can easily control and study mice to learn how the brain works. In the past, researchers mostly used male mice. They did this because female mice have different hormone levels that can change how they behave. This could affect the study results."
