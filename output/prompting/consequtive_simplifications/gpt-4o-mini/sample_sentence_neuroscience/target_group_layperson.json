    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They help scientists study the brain. Researchers can control and study them easily. \n\nIn the past, scientists mostly used male mice in their experiments. They were concerned about female mice. Female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can affect behavior and may change results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They help scientists learn about how the brain works. Researchers can easily control and examine them.\n\nIn the past, scientists mostly used male mice in their tests. They were worried about female mice. Female mice have hormone changes. These changes can affect behavior and may change the results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are very important for studying how the brain works. They help scientists understand more about brain activities. Researchers can easily manage and observe them.\n\nIn earlier studies, scientists mostly chose male mice for their experiments. This was because they were concerned about using female mice. Female mice go through changes in hormones, which are natural chemicals in their bodies. These hormone changes can affect how they behave, and this might lead to different outcomes in experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
