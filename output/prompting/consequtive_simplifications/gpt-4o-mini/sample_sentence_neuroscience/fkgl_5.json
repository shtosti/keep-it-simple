The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 5.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are a big part of brain research. Scientists use them to learn about the brain's inner workings. Researchers have often chosen male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can change behavior and affect the results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are an important part of studying the brain. Scientists use them to understand how the brain works. Researchers often pick male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have hormone changes. These changes can affect their behavior and the results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are an important part of studying the brain. Scientists use them to understand how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have changes in hormones, which are chemicals in the body that control many functions. These changes can make female mice behave differently, which might change the results of the tests.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use them to learn how the brain works. Researchers usually pick male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have changes in hormones, which can affect their behavior and the results of the tests."
