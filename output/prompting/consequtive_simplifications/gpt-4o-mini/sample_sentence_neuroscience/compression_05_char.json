    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They provide a controllable model for studying the brain. Researchers have often preferred male mice. This is partly because female mice's hormone cycles can cause behavioral changes. These changes can affect the results of experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for brain research. They are easy to control for studying how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice. This is partly because female mice's hormone changes can cause behavior changes. These changes can impact the results of tests.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They are easy to handle for learning how the brain functions. Researchers usually pick male mice for their tests. This is partly because female mice's hormone changes can lead to different behaviors. These behavior changes can affect the outcomes of their experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They are easy to handle for learning how the brain works. Researchers usually choose male mice for tests. This is partly because female mice's hormone changes can lead to different behaviors, which can affect the outcomes of experiments."
