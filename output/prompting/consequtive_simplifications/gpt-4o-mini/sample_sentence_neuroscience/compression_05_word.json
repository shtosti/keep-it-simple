    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of words in the output text should be 0.5 of the original.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are central to neuroscience research. They provide a flexible model for scientists to study the brain. Historically, researchers preferred male mice. This preference was partly due to concerns about female hormone cycles. Hormonal variations in females could affect results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for brain research. They provide a useful model for scientists to study how the brain works. In the past, researchers chose male mice more often. This was partly because of worries about female hormone cycles. Hormone changes in females could change the results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are key for studying the brain. They are a useful example for scientists to understand brain function. In the past, researchers mostly used male mice. This was because they were concerned about the effects of hormones in female mice. Hormones are chemicals in the body that can change how animals behave, which might affect the findings of the studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are key for studying the brain. They help scientists understand how the brain works. In the past, researchers often chose male mice because they were worried about the effects of hormones in females. Hormones can change behavior, which might affect study results."
