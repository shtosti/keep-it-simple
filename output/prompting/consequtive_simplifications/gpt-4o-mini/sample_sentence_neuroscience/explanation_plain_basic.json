Researchers have mostly used male mice in experiments. They worry that female mice's hormone changes cause behavior changes. These changes might affect the results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in studying the brain. They are a useful way to learn about how the brain works. Scientists can easily manage and observe them. Researchers usually choose male mice for tests. They are concerned that hormone changes in female mice might lead to different behaviors. These behavior changes could affect the outcomes of their studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They help us learn how the brain works. Scientists can easily manage and observe them. Researchers often pick male mice for experiments. They worry that hormone changes in female mice might cause different behaviors. These behavior changes could affect the results of their studies."
