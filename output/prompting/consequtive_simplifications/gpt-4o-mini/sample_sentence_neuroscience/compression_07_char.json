    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of characters in the output text should be 0.7 of the original.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are central to neuroscience research. They are a flexible model for studying the brain. Researchers often prefer male mice. This preference is partly due to hormonal cycles in females. These cycles can cause behavioral variations. Such variations might affect experimental results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. They are a useful model for studying the brain. Researchers often choose male mice. This is partly because female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can change behavior. Such changes might affect test results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in studying how the brain works. They are a good choice for researchers because they can be easily controlled. Scientists often prefer to use male mice for experiments. This is partially because female mice experience changes in hormones each month. These hormone changes can alter their behavior, which might impact the accuracy of the results in experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They are easy for researchers to work with. Scientists usually use male mice in experiments. This is because female mice have monthly hormone changes that can change their behavior. These changes might affect the results of experiments."
