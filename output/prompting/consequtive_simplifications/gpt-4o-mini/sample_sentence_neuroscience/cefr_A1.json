    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is A1. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the A1 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.>",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists use mice to learn about the brain. Researchers often use male mice in experiments. They do this because female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can change behavior. This change can affect research results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain studies. Scientists use mice to learn about the brain. Researchers often use boy mice in tests. They do this because girl mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can change how they act. This change can affect study results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in brain studies. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often use boy mice in tests. They do this because girl mice have hormone cycles. Hormones are chemicals in the body that can change how animals behave. These cycles can change how girl mice act. This change can affect the results of the studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",

They do this because girl mice have hormone cycles. Hormones are chemicals that can change how animals behave. These cycles can change how girl mice act. This can affect the results of the studies."
