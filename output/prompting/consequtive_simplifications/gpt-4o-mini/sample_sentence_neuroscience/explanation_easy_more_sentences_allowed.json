    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Easy English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. It can contain more sentences than the original if it makes it easier to understand.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They allow scientists to learn more about the brain. Mice are a flexible model. Scientists can control and study them.\n\nResearchers often choose male mice for experiments. They do this because of concerns about female mice. Female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can cause changes in behavior. These changes might affect the results of the experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They help scientists learn more about how the brain works. Mice are a good option because scientists can easily control and observe them.\n\nResearchers usually pick male mice for experiments. They do this because they worry about female mice. Female mice have a cycle of hormones. This cycle can change their behavior. These changes might affect the findings of the experiments.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are very important for studying the brain. They help scientists understand how the brain works. Mice are a good choice because scientists can easily control their environment and watch them closely.\n\nResearchers usually choose to work with male mice when doing experiments. They do this because they have concerns about using female mice. Female mice go through a cycle that involves hormones. Hormones are chemicals in the body that affect how animals behave. This cycle can change how female mice act. These changes might make it harder to get clear results from the experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
