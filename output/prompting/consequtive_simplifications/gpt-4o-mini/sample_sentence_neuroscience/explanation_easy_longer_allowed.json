    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by rewriting them in Easy English. Use clear, descriptive and explanatory language. Your simplification can be longer than the source text if making it longer makes it easier to comprehend.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They help scientists study the brain. Mice are a flexible model. Scientists can control and examine them. Researchers usually choose male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can cause changes in behavior. These changes might affect the research results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in studying how the brain works. They help scientists learn about the brain. Mice are a useful choice. Scientists can manage and look closely at them. Researchers usually pick male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can cause changes in how they act. These changes might affect the study results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are very important for studying how the brain works. They help scientists understand more about the brain's activities and functions. Mice are a good choice for research because they are easy for scientists to handle and observe closely. \n\nMost researchers prefer to use male mice in their experiments. One reason for this choice is that female mice experience a hormone cycle, which means their hormone levels change regularly. This cycle can cause female mice to behave differently at different times. These changes in behavior could make it harder for scientists to get clear and accurate results from their studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
