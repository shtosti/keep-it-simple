    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 8.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They provide a flexible model for scientists. Researchers can control and study mice to learn about the brain. Historically, scientists have preferred male mice for experiments. They chose male mice because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can cause changes in behavior. These changes could affect the results of the experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. They are a good model for scientists. Researchers can control and study mice to learn about how the brain works. In the past, scientists liked using male mice for experiments. They chose male mice because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can cause changes in behavior. These changes could affect the results of the experiments.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in studying how the brain works. They are a good model for scientists because they are easy to control and observe. In the past, scientists preferred using male mice for their experiments. They chose male mice because female mice have a cycle related to hormones, which are chemicals in the body that affect behavior. This cycle can cause differences in how female mice act. These differences might change the results of the experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying how the brain works. They are easy for scientists to control and observe. Scientists often picked male mice for their experiments. They did this because female mice have a hormone cycle, which can change how they behave. These changes might affect the results of the experiments."
