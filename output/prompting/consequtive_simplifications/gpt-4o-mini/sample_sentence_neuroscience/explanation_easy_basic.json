    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They are a flexible model for scientists. Researchers can control and study mice. This helps them learn about how the brain works. \n\nIn the past, researchers preferred male mice for experiments. They did this because they were worried about female mice. Female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can cause changes in behavior. This could affect the results of experiments.",

This helps them learn about how the brain works.\n\nIn the past, researchers preferred to use male mice for tests. They did this because they were worried about female mice. Female mice go through hormone cycles, which are changes in their body that affect their mood and behavior. These changes can make their actions different from male mice. This could change the results of the tests.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists can easily manage and study them. This helps them understand how the brain works.\n\nIn the past, researchers preferred using male mice for tests. They were worried about female mice because of hormone cycles. These cycles cause changes in their mood and behavior. This can make them act differently than male mice and affect the test results."
