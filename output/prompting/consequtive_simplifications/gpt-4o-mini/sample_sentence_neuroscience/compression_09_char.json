    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of characters in the output text should be 0.9 of the original.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are vital in neuroscience research. They offer a controllable model for scientists to study the brain. Researchers have often preferred male mice in experiments. This preference is partly due to concerns about hormonal cycles in females. These cycles can cause behavioral variations that may affect results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. They provide a controllable model for scientists to study how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. This is partly because they worry about hormone changes in female mice. These changes can cause differences in behavior that might influence results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are essential in studying the brain. They serve as a model that scientists can easily control to learn how the brain functions. Researchers usually select male mice for their experiments. One reason for this choice is that they are concerned about hormonal changes in female mice. These changes can lead to variations in behavior that could affect the outcomes of the studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They are easy to control and help scientists understand how the brain works. Researchers often use male mice in experiments. They worry that hormones in female mice might cause differences in behavior that could change the results."
