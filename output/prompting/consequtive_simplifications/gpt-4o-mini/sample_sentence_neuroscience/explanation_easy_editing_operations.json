    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. Scientists use them to learn about the brain. Mice are a flexible model. Researchers can control and study them.\n\nHistorically, researchers have used more male mice than female mice in experiments. They worry about female hormone cycles. These cycles can change behavior. This change can affect the results of the experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists use them to learn about how the brain works. Mice are a useful type of model. Researchers can control and study them easily.\n\nIn the past, researchers have used more male mice than female mice in tests. They worry about female hormone changes. These changes can affect behavior. This can change the results of the tests.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice play an important role in studying the brain. Scientists use mice to understand how the brain functions. Mice are a helpful type of model because they are easy to manage and observe.\n\nIn the past, researchers preferred to use more male mice than female mice in their experiments. They are concerned that changes in female hormones, which are natural substances in the body that influence how animals behave, can cause differences in behavior. These differences can impact the results of the experiments, making it harder to understand the findings.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn how the brain works. Mice are easy to manage and observe.\n\nResearchers often choose male mice over female mice in their experiments. They worry that changes in female hormones can affect behavior. These changes can make it difficult to understand the results of the experiments."
