    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is B1. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the B1 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. Can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. Can produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar or of personal interest. Can describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes & ambitions and briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans.>",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. Scientists study mice to learn about the brain. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can change behavior. This change can affect the results of experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists study mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can change how they act. This change can affect the results of the tests.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists study mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle, which is a regular change in their body due to hormones. This cycle can change how female mice act. This change can affect the results of the tests.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists study mice to learn how the brain works. Researchers usually choose male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle, which is a regular change in their bodies. This cycle can change how female mice behave. This change can affect the results of the tests."
