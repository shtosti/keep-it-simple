    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important for neuroscience research. They are a flexible model for scientists. Researchers can control and study them to learn about the brain's complex functions. In the past, scientists preferred male mice for experiments. They were concerned that female mice's hormone cycle could cause changes in behavior. This variation could affect the experiment results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They are a useful model for scientists. Researchers can control and observe them to learn about how the brain works. In the past, scientists chose male mice for experiments. They worried that female mice\u2019s hormone changes could lead to changes in behavior. These changes could affect the experiment results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice play a key role in research about the brain. They are helpful for scientists because they can be easily controlled and studied. This lets researchers learn more about how the brain operates. \n\nIn the past, scientists mostly used male mice for their experiments. They were concerned that female mice\u2019s hormone cycles, which are the regular changes that happen in their bodies, could cause different behaviors. These differences in behavior could impact the outcomes of the experiments, making it harder to get clear results.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
