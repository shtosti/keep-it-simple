    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for the following target group: non-native English speakers with a beginner level of English. Rewrite the text in plain language to make it easily understandable for them.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important for brain research. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can change behavior. Those changes might affect the results of the experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose boy mice for experiments. They do this because girl mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle can change how they act. Those changes might affect the results of the experiments.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn how the brain works. Researchers often choose boy mice for experiments. They do this because girl mice have a hormone cycle, which is a regular change in their body that affects their hormones. This cycle can change how girl mice act. These changes might affect the results of the experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn how the brain works. Researchers mostly use boy mice in experiments. They do this because girl mice have a hormone cycle. This cycle changes how girl mice behave. These changes might affect the results of the experiments."
