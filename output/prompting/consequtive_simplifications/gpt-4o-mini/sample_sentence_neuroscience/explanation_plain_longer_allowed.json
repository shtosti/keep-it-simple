    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They are a flexible model for scientists to study the brain. Researchers often use male mice in experiments. They do this because of concerns about female mice. Female mice have hormone cycles that can cause changes in behavior. This variation might affect research results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in studying the brain. They are a useful model for scientists. Researchers often use male mice in experiments. They do this because they are worried about female mice. Female mice have hormone changes that can affect their behavior. This can change the results of the research.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important for studying how the brain works. Scientists use them because they are easy to handle and observe. Many researchers prefer to use male mice in their experiments. One reason for this choice is that they are concerned about female mice. Female mice experience hormonal changes due to their monthly cycle, which can affect their behavior. These changes can make the results of the research less reliable or clear.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
