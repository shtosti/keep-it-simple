    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They are a flexible model. Scientists can control and study mice to learn about the brain. Researchers have often used male mice in experiments. This is because they are concerned that female mice's hormone cycles cause changes in behavior. These changes could affect the results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. They are an adaptable model. Scientists can control and study mice to learn about the brain. Researchers have often used male mice in experiments. This is because they worry that female mice's hormone levels cause changes in behavior. These changes could affect the results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice play a key role in studies about the brain. They are an adaptable model, meaning they can be easily managed and examined by scientists. Researchers often choose to work with male mice in their experiments. This is because they are concerned that the hormone fluctuations in female mice can lead to changes in their behavior. Such changes might make the results of the experiments less reliable.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in studies about the brain. They can be easily managed and examined by scientists. Researchers often use male mice in experiments because they worry that hormone changes in female mice can affect their behavior. These changes might make the results less reliable."
