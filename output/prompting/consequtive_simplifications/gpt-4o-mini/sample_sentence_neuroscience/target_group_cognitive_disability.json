    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important for neuroscience research. Scientists study mice to learn about how the brain works. \n\nResearchers often use male mice in experiments. They do this because they worry about female mice. Female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can change their behavior. This change could affect the results of the experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists look at mice to learn how the brain works.\n\nResearchers often use boy mice in experiments. They do this because they worry about girl mice. Girl mice have hormone levels that change. These changes can affect their behavior. This could change the findings of the experiments.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are very important for studying how the brain works. Scientists check how mice behave to understand the brain better. \n\nResearchers usually use boy mice for their experiments. They do this because they are concerned about girl mice. Girl mice go through changes in their bodies called hormone cycles. These changes can make them act differently. If they act differently, it might change what scientists find in their studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
