    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of words in the output text should be 0.9 of the original.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are central to neuroscience research. They provide a flexible model for scientists to study the brain. Researchers have historically favored male mice in experiments. This preference is partly due to concerns about female hormones affecting behavior.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain studies. They offer a useful way for scientists to learn about how the brain works. Researchers have often chosen male mice for tests. This choice is partly because of worries about female hormones changing behavior.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in brain studies. They provide a useful way for scientists to learn about the brain's functions. Researchers often pick male mice for experiments. This choice is partly because they are concerned that hormones in female mice could change their behavior and affect the results.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain studies. They help scientists learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. This is partly because they worry that hormones in female mice might change their behavior and affect the results."
