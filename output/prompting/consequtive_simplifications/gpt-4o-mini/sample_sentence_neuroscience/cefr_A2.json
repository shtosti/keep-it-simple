    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is A2. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the A2 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.>",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. Scientists use mice to learn about the brain. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have hormone cycles. These cycles can change behavior. This can make results less clear.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have hormone changes. These changes can affect behavior. This can make results less clear.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have hormone changes. Hormones are substances in the body that can affect how an animal behaves. These changes can affect behavior. This can make results less clear or harder to understand.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research. Scientists use mice to learn how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for tests. They do this because female mice have hormone changes. Hormones are substances in the body that can change how an animal acts. These changes can affect behavior, making the results harder to understand."
