    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for the following target group: people with intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, development delay, etc.). Rewrite the text in easy language to make it easily understandable for them.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. They do this because female mice have hormones. These hormones can change behavior. This can make results less clear.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn about how the brain works. Researchers often choose boy mice for tests. They do this because girl mice have hormones. Hormones can change how mice act. This can make the results harder to understand.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important for studying how the brain works. Scientists use mice to learn about the brain. Researchers often choose boy mice for their tests. They do this because girl mice have hormones. Hormones are special chemicals in the body that can change how someone behaves or acts. This can make it harder to understand the results of the tests.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice to learn about the brain. Researchers often choose boy mice for tests. They do this because girl mice have hormones. Hormones are special chemicals in the body that can change how someone acts. This can make it harder to understand the results of the tests."
