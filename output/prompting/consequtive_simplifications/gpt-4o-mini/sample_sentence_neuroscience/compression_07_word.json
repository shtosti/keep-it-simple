    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts by making them shorter. The number of words in the output text should be 0.7 of the original.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are central to neuroscience research. They offer a flexible model for scientists to control and study brain function. Researchers have historically favored male mice. This preference is due to concerns about behavioral variation in female mice caused by the hormone cycle, which could affect results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important to brain research. They provide a useful model for scientists to control and study how the brain works. Researchers have usually preferred male mice. This choice is because they worry that changes in female mice due to hormones might impact results.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice play a key role in studying the brain. They are a helpful option for scientists to manage and examine brain functions. Researchers often choose male mice for experiments. This is because they are concerned that hormonal changes in female mice could lead to differences in behavior, which might affect the findings of the studies.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. They help scientists manage and examine how the brain works. Researchers often use male mice in experiments. They worry that hormonal changes in female mice could cause behavior differences and affect the study results."
