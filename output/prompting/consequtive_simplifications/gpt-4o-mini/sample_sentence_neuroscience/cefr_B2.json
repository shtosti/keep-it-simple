    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is B2. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the B2 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation. Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party. Can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.>",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They are a flexible model that scientists can control. Scientists study mice to learn about the brain. Researchers have often used male mice in experiments. They prefer male mice because of concerns about female hormones. The hormone cycle in female mice can change behavior. This change might affect the results of experiments.",

    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important in research about the brain. They are a useful model that scientists can control easily. Scientists study mice to understand how the brain works and functions. Researchers often choose male mice for their experiments. They prefer male mice because they are concerned about hormones in female mice. \n\nHormones are chemicals in the body that can affect behavior and feelings. Female mice have a hormone cycle, which means their hormone levels change regularly. This change can lead to different behaviors in female mice. If researchers use female mice, these behavior changes might affect the results of their experiments and make them less reliable.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
