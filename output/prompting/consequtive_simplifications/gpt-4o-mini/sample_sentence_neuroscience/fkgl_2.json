    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 2.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important for brain research. Scientists can easily control and study mice. This helps them learn about how the brain works. Researchers used to choose male mice for experiments. They did this because of concerns about female hormones. Hormones can change female behavior. This change could affect the results.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists can easily manage and look at mice. This helps them learn about how the brain works. Researchers used to pick male mice for tests. They did this because they were worried about female hormones. Hormones can change how females act. This change could affect the findings.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists can easily manage and observe mice. This helps them learn about how the brain functions. Researchers often chose male mice for their tests. They did this because they were concerned about female hormones. Hormones are special chemicals in the body that can change how someone behaves. These changes in females could affect the results of the experiments.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists can easily manage and watch mice. This helps them learn how the brain works. Researchers often picked male mice for their tests. They did this because they were worried about female hormones. Hormones are body chemicals that can change behavior. These changes in females could affect the test results."
