The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 11.",
    "syntactic_simplification": "Mice are important in neuroscience research. They are a flexible model for scientists. Researchers can control and study mice to learn about the brain. In the past, researchers preferred male mice. They did this because they were worried about female hormones. The hormone cycle in females can cause changes in behavior. These changes might affect the results of experiments.",
    "lexical_simplification": "Mice are important in brain research. They are a useful model for scientists. Researchers can control and study mice to learn about the brain. In the past, researchers liked male mice more than female mice. They did this because they were concerned about female hormones. The hormone cycle in females can cause changes in behavior. These changes might affect the results of tests.",
    "paraphrase_or_explanation": "Mice are very important in studying the brain. They are useful for scientists because they can control and study them easily. Scientists use mice to learn more about how the brain works. \n\nIn the past, researchers usually chose to work with male mice instead of female mice. They did this because they were worried about hormones in female mice. Hormones are natural chemicals in the body that can affect how an animal behaves. The hormone cycle in female mice can lead to different behaviors. These changes in behavior could change the results of experiments or tests that scientists conduct.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important for studying the brain. Scientists use them because they can control and study them easily. They help researchers learn how the brain works. \n\nIn the past, scientists usually chose male mice for their studies. They were worried about hormones in female mice. Hormones are natural substances in the body that can change how animals act. The hormone cycle in female mice can lead to different behaviors. These changes could affect the results of the experiments."
