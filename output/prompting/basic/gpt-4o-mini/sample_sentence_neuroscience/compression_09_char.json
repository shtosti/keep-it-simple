    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are key to neuroscience research, allowing scientists to study brain functions. Researchers have traditionally preferred male mice for experiments, worrying that females' hormonal cycles may cause behavioral variations that affect results."
