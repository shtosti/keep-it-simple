    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are key to neuroscience research, serving as a controllable model for studying the brain. Researchers have often preferred male mice to female ones because hormonal cycles in females can lead to behavioral variations that might affect results."
