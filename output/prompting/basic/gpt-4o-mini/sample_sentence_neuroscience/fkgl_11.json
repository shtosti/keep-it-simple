The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 11.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice play an important role in studying the brain. Scientists like to use them because they are easy to control and learn about how the brain works. For a long time, researchers have mostly used male mice in their experiments. They worry that female mice have hormone cycles that can make their behavior change, which might affect the results of the studies."
