    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important for studying the brain. Scientists use mice because they are easy to manage and study. Usually, researchers choose male mice for experiments instead of female mice. They do this because the hormones in female mice can cause changes in behavior, which might affect the results of the research."
