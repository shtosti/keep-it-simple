    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are key in neuroscience research, allowing scientists to study brain functions. Researchers often prefer male mice for experiments, worried that female hormone cycles may lead to inconsistent results."
