    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in brain research. Scientists use them because they are easier to manage and study, helping us understand how the brain works. Over the years, researchers have mostly used male mice for their experiments. They chose male mice because they were worried that the hormone changes in female mice could lead to different behaviors. This might make it harder to get clear results from the experiments."
