    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important for research in neuroscience, which is the study of the brain. Scientists like to use mice because they are easy to manage and help us understand how the brain works. For a long time, researchers have mostly used male mice in their experiments. One reason for this is that female mice have a hormone cycle that can change their behavior, and scientists worry this might affect the outcomes of the studies."
