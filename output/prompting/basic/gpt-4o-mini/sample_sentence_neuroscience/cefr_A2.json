    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in brain research. Scientists use them to learn about how the brain works. In the past, researchers often chose male mice for experiments. They did this because they were worried that female mice, with their hormone changes, might act differently and make the study results less clear."
