    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for children. The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 5.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain studies because scientists can easily control and observe them. For a long time, researchers mostly used male mice instead of female mice. They did this because female mice have hormone changes that might affect how they behave, which could mess up the study results."
