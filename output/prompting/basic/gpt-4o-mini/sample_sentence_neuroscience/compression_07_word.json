    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are crucial in neuroscience research, offering a manageable model for studying brain functions. Researchers traditionally prefer male mice in experiments due to concerns that female hormone cycles may introduce behavioral variations affecting results."
