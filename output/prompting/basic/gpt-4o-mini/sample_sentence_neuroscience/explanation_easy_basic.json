    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use them because they are easy to control and observe. For a long time, researchers have mostly used male mice in experiments. They believed that female mice might behave differently because of their hormones, which could affect the results."
