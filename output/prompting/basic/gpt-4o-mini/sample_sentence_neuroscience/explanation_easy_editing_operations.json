    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice have been important for studying the brain in science. They are easy to control and study. For a long time, researchers have mostly used male mice in their experiments. This is because they worry that the hormone changes in female mice might make the results less reliable."
