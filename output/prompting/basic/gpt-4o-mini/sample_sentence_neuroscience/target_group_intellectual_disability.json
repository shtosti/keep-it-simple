    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are small animals that help scientists learn about how the brain works. Scientists usually use male mice more than female mice in their studies. They do this because female mice have hormones that change, which can make their behavior different. This can make it harder to get clear results from the experiments."
