    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for neuroscience research. Scientists study mice to understand how the brain works. For a long time, researchers usually used male mice in their experiments. They did this because they were worried that the female mice's hormone cycles could change their behavior and affect the results."
