    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice have been an important part of brain research because they are easy to work with. Scientists can control and study them to learn how the brain works. In the past, researchers often chose male mice for experiments because they were worried that the hormonal changes in female mice could affect the results."
