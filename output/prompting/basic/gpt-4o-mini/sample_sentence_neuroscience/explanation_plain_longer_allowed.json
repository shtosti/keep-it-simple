    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important for studying the brain in science. They are a useful model because researchers can easily manage and observe them to better understand how the brain works. For many years, scientists have chosen to use male mice more than female mice in their experiments. This is partly because female mice go through a hormonal cycle, which can lead to changes in their behavior. Scientists worry that these changes could affect the results of their studies."
