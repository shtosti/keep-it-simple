    "prompt_used": "You simplify complex texts for non-native English speakers, whose English mastery level is B2. Adapt the text to the needs of the target group. Here is the definition of the B2 level according to CEFR (Common European Framework for Languages): <Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation. Can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party. Can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.>",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important in brain research because they are easy to study and help scientists understand how the brain works. In the past, researchers preferred to use male mice instead of female mice. This was partly because they were worried that the hormone changes in female mice could affect their behavior and make the results less reliable."
