    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are very important in science, especially in studying the brain. Scientists use mice because they are easy to control and study. This helps them understand how the brain works.\n\nIn the past, researchers mostly used male mice for their experiments. They chose male mice because they worried that female mice have hormone changes, which can affect their behavior. This behavior change could make it hard to get accurate results in the experiments."
