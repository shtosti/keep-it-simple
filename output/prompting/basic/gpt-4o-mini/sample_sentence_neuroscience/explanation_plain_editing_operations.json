    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice have been very important in brain research because they are a convenient model for scientists to study and understand how the brain works. In the past, researchers often used male mice instead of female mice in experiments. They did this partly because they worried that the hormone cycle in female mice might cause changes in behavior that could affect the results."
