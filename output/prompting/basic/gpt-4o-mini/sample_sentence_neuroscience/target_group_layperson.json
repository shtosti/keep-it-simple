    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for brain research because they are easy to work with and help scientists understand how brains function. In the past, researchers usually used male mice instead of female mice. This was mainly because they were worried that female mice, with their changing hormone levels, might behave differently and make the results less reliable."
