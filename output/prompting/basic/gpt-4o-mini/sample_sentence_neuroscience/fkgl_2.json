The FKGL score of the output (Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level) approximates the reading grade of the text, using the following formula: 0.39 x (words/sentences) + 11.8 x (syllables/words) \u2013 15.59. Target FKGL score of your simplification equals 2.",
    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use them because they can easily control and observe their behavior. In the past, researchers mostly used male mice. They did this because they were worried that female mice might act differently because of their hormones, which could change the experiment results."
