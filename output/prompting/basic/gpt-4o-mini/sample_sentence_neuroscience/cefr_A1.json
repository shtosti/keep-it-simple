    "original_text": "Mice have long been a central part of neuroscience research, providing a flexible model that scientists can control and study to learn more about the intricate inner workings of the brain. Historically, researchers have favored male mice over female mice in experiments, in part due to concern that the hormone cycle in females causes behavioral variation that could throw off results.",
    "simplified_text": "Mice are important for studying the brain. Scientists use them to learn how the brain works. Many researchers use male mice more than female mice in experiments. They think that female mice can behave differently because of their hormones. This can make the results hard to understand."
