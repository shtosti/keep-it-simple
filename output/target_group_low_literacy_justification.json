    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds when things make vibrations. These vibrations move a small bone in the ear called the stapes. This helps send sounds to the part of the ear that helps us hear, called the cochlea.\n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by removing complex scientific terms and breaking down the information into smaller, clearer sentences. This makes it easier for low-literacy individuals to understand the main idea without getting confused by difficult words or concepts."
