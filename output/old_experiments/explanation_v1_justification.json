    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals can hear sounds from their environment. When a sound occurs, it creates vibrations. These vibrations move through a tiny bone in the middle of the ear called the stapes. The stapes helps send these vibrations to a special part of the ear called the cochlea, which is responsible for hearing.\n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by breaking down technical terms and concepts into simpler language. I explained what the cochlea and stapes are in the context of hearing, using more straightforward words to make it easier to understand. This approach helps people who may find scientific language confusing to grasp the main idea without getting lost in jargon."
