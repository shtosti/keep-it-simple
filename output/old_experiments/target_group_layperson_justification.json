    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds from their environment because vibrations travel through tiny bones in their ears, reaching a special part called the cochlea that helps them hear.\n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by removing technical terms and breaking down the concepts into simpler ideas. This way, laypeople can easily understand how mammals hear sounds without needing to know scientific jargon. The main points are kept intact to convey the same message in a clearer manner."
