    "simplified_text": "In mammals, sounds from the environment cause vibrations in a tiny bone called the stapes, which is found in the middle part of the ear. These vibrations then activate the cochlea, which is the part of the ear that helps us hear. The cochlea has special cells that respond to sounds, allowing us to hear and understand what we are listening to."
