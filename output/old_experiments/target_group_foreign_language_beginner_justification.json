    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds from the environment. These sounds make the cochlea, a part of the ear, move. The stapes, a small bone in the ear, helps with this movement.\n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by breaking down complex terms and using simpler language. I replaced \"environmental sounds\" with \"sounds from the environment\" and explained what the cochlea and stapes are in simpler terms. This way, non-native English speakers with a beginner level can understand the meaning better."
