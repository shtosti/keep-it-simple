    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds through a part of their ear called the cochlea. Sounds make a tiny bone in the ear, called the stapes, vibrate. \n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by breaking it down into shorter sentences and using common words to explain what happens in the ear when we hear sounds. This makes it easier for elderly people to understand because complex terms and long sentences can be confusing. It helps to keep the information clear and straightforward."
