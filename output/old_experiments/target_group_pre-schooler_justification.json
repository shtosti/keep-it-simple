    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds from the environment because tiny parts in their ears vibrate when sounds happen. This helps them listen to different noises. \n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by using simpler words and shorter sentences. Pre-school children understand basic concepts better when they are explained in a straightforward way. The original text used complex terms like \"auditory receptor,\" \"cochlea,\" and \"ossicles,\" which are too difficult for young children. I focused on the main idea\u2014how mammals hear\u2014to make it easier for them to understand."
