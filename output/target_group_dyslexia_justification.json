    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "Mammals hear sounds through a part of their ear called the cochlea. Sounds make the tiny bone called the stapes move. This helps us hear.\n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by breaking down complex terms and using simpler words. For example, I replaced \"auditory receptor\" with \"part of their ear\" and explained what the stapes does in a straightforward way. This makes it easier for someone with severe dyslexia to understand the main idea without getting stuck on difficult words."
