    "original_text": "In mammals, environmental sounds stimulate the auditory receptor, the cochlea, via vibrations of the stapes, the innermost of the middle ear ossicles.",
    "simplified_text": "In mammals, sounds from the environment activate the cochlea, which is the part of the ear that helps us hear. This happens through vibrations caused by a small bone in the ear called the stapes. \n\n<EXPLANATION> I simplified the text by breaking down complex terms and phrases into simpler ones. \"Environmental sounds\" became \"sounds from the environment,\" \"auditory receptor\" was changed to \"part of the ear that helps us hear,\" and I avoided technical details. This makes it easier for non-native speakers with an intermediate level of English to understand the main idea without getting lost in complicated vocabulary."
